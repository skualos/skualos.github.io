I've been wanting to create a blog for some time. Now that I finished my [GIS master's degree](http://www.fc.ul.pt/pt/cursos/mestrado/sistemas-de-informacao-geografica---tecnologias-e-aplicacoes) at [Lisbon's University Faculty of Science](http://www.fc.ul.pt) I have a little more time available for that.

I choose to create the blog using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and host it on [Github](https://github.com/). The reasons are to force myself to learn more about HTML and CSS, as well as managing projects using Git. Let's see how it works out!

To set up the blog I followed [this great tutorial](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/01/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) from [Barry Clarck](http://www.barryclark.co/) that got me up and running in no time. Thanks Barry!
