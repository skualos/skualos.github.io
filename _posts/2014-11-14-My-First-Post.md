I've been wanting to create a blog for some time. Now that I finished my GIS master's degree at [Lisbon's University Faculty of Science](http://www.fc.ul.pt){:target="_blank"} I have a little more time available for that.

I chose to create the blog using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank"} and host it on [Github](https://github.com/){:target="_blank"}. It seems to be a good workflow for a simple blog, and it will also be a way for me to learn how to manage projects using Git.

To set up the blog I followed [this great tutorial](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/01/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/){:target="_blank"} from [Barry Clarck](http://www.barryclark.co/){:target="_blank"} that got me up and running in no time. Thanks Barry!
